 How to Use:
A separate folder is created for each project which contains data set and Notebook. In each notebook you will find how I tried to solve the given problem and what were my findings and business recommendations.

**Project 1: Customer Profiling Using Exploratory Data Analysis **
**Goals**: To execute preliminary data analysis by exploring the dataset and coming up with some basic observations about the data. Build customer profile to help capitalize based on it. Also, extract actionable insights that drive the sales of the business.
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Visualization techniques
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Project 2: Predicting prices of used case using Supervised Linear Regression Techniques**
**Goals**: Using the Cars4U dataset, need to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	EDA
•	Linear regression
•	Linear regression assumptions
•	Business insights and suggestions

**Project 3: Bank Personal Loan Campaign Modelling using decision tree (Supervised Learning: Classification)**
**Goal:** Given customer dataset was used to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	EDA
•	Data Pre-processing
•	Logistic regression
•	Finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve
•	Decision trees
•	Pruning

**Project 4: Predicting Travel Package Purchase Using Ensemble Techniques**
**Goal**: The "Visit with us" travel company dataset is used to analyze the customers' information and build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced package.
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	EDA
•	Data Preprocessing
•	Customer Profiling
•	Bagging Classifiers - Bagging and Random Forest
•	Boosting Classifier - AdaBoost
•	Gradient Boosting
•	XGBoost
•	Stacking Classifier
•	Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
•	Business Recommendations

**Project 5: Customer Churn prediction using Adabost, XG most and identification of important Feature.**  
**Goal**: To predict whether a customer will leave the credit card services or not and the reason behind it
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	Cross validation
•	Regularization
•	Pipelines and Hyperparameter tuning.
•	Up and Down Sampling

**Project 6: Customer Segmentation using unsupervised Learning Technique-Clustering.**
**Goal**: To identify different segments in the existing customer, based on their spending patterns as well as past interaction with the bank, using clustering algorithms, and provide recommendations to the bank on how to better market to and service these customers.
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	EDA
•	Clustering (K-means and Hierarchical)
•	Cluster Profiling

**Project 7: Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks**
**Goal:** To help the operations team identify the customers that are more likely to churn by building an artificial Neural Network from scratch.
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	TensorFlow
•	Keras
•	ANN
•	Google colab

**Project 8: Plant Seedling Classification using CNN.** 
**Goal:** To identify the plant seedlings species from 12 different species using a convolutional neural network
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	Keras
•	CNN
•	Working with images 
•	Computer Vision 

**Project 9: Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing**
**Goals:** Identify the sentiment from a tweet to understand an airlines' customer satisfaction
**Skills & Tools Covered:**
•	Working with text
•	Vectorization (count vectorizer and tf-idf vectorizer)
•	Sentiment Analysis 
•	Parameter Tuning 
•	Confusion Matrix based model evaluation.
